I'm a cybersecurity bootcamp graduate from the University of Minnesota, actively pursuing a role as a SOC Analyst. I have a background in IT support and a growing passion for threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

This GitHub is where I document my blue team learning journey, including labs, log sources, Event Logs, and detection techniques mapped to the MITRE ATTACK framework.
